# Advent of code 2022

My solutions for some of the coding puzzles from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2022 event.

## 01 Calorie Counting

The elves are carrying multiple snacks and we want to find out how many calories the elves are carrying with the greatest sum from their snacks.


## 02 Rock Paper Scissors

The elves are hosting a Rock Paper Scissors tournament. The task in this is to calculate the expected score based on different interpretations of the given strategy guide.


## 03 Rucksack Reorganization

The Backpacks of the elves were not packed as intended. The task is to find common items between different backpacks.
